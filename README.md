# Networking-Python

Welcome to the Networking-Python repository! This project contains several Python scripts demonstrating various networking concepts and functionalities.

## Files

- **TCP-client.py**: A simple TCP client that connects to a TCP server, sends a message, and receives a response.
- **TCP-server.py**: A basic TCP server that listens for incoming connections, receives messages, and sends responses.
- **UDP-client.py**: A UDP client that sends messages to a UDP server and receives responses.
- **netcat.py**: A Python implementation of the netcat utility, useful for debugging and investigating the network.
- **proxy.py**: A proxy server that forwards requests from clients to other servers, potentially adding some form of processing or logging.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jayeshkaithwas/Networking-Python.git
```

Navigate to the cloned directory:

```sh
cd Networking-Python
```

### Usage

#### TCP Client and Server

1. Start the TCP server:
    ```sh
    python TCP-server.py
    ```

2. In a new terminal, start the TCP client:
    ```sh
    python TCP-client.py
    ```

#### UDP Client

1. Make sure you have a UDP server running. You can use an existing one or create your own.

2. Start the UDP client:
    ```sh
    python UDP-client.py
    ```

#### Netcat Utility

Run the netcat script with the appropriate arguments. For example, to connect to a host:
```sh
python netcat.py hostname port
```

#### Proxy Server

Start the proxy server:
```sh
python proxy.py
```

Then configure your client to use this proxy.
